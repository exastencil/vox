# Vox Aetatum Wiki

This folder contains technical documentation and design notes for the Vox Aetatum engine and its reference content.

- Minecraft Technical Summary (reference): See `minecraft-technical-summary.md` for an overview of systems we aim to replicate as a baseline for the engine and the base game mods.

Over time we will expand this with:
- Engine architecture notes
- Modding API guides and examples
- Base game design docs
- Implementation details and roadmaps
